## 🧠 How It Works

1. The app stores an array of user objects.
2. All users are initially displayed.
3. As the user types in the search input, the app filters the users using JavaScript (`filter`, `startsWith`, etc.).
4. The previous results are cleared and the filtered list is re-rendered dynamically without reloading the page.
